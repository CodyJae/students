My name is Jacob Massengill, and I am a junior year undergraduate student majoring in computer science.
I come from a small town in west Tennessee, where I went to highschool; UT is the first University I have attended. 

I know three programming languages as of right now: C/C++, Java, and Python. My main interests are in the fields of cyber 
security and application development. I have worked on several small standalone projects, as well thrown around some ideas
in the Unreal Engine 4 game engine. I plan to focus moreso on app development for the time being, hopefully finding time
to build a small Android game for a side project.
