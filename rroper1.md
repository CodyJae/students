My name is Ryan Roper and I'm a senior. I'm a computer science major. 
I know how to program in C, C++, Java and Python although I don't claim to be a master at any of them. 
I've played rugby here at UT for 4 years and am helping coach during my 5th year here. 
I am also in Air Force ROTC and plan on being a Cyber Space Operations officer once I commission in the spring.
