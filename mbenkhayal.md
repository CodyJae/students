My name is Muhammed Benkhayal, and I am a senior in computer science. I have a broad range of interests within
the field, and loving learning about new things. I interned this past summer with Optum Technology
(United Health Group) and learned a lot. Outside of the field, I enjoy soccer, basketball, and hiking.
