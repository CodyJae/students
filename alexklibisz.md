Hi I'm Alex Klibisz. I'm a senior in CS. My primary interests and experience so far have been in web and mobile development. For the past year or so I've been programming primarily full-stack Javascript. I've spent a couple co-op terms with Cadre5 here in Knoxville as well as some work at a university in Germany last summer. In this class I hope to learn new, creative approaches to handling and learning from data.
