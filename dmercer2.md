I am David Mercer, a second year student in the Business Analytics master's
program. I plan to pursue a career in data science and am interested in learning
anything I can about data management, manipulation, and analysis. I currently
work for  OIT Research Computing Support, providing statistical consulting to
researchers at UT. I am also an analytics intern at PYA Analytics.

My favorite activity, by far, is rock climbing. I like sport leading and bouldering
and try to go outside to climb at least one day every weekend. I also like building
computers and gaming when I have the money for the former and the time for the
latter.
