Hi, my name is Chris Daffron. I am a Master's student in Computer Engineering working under Dr. Dean. Specifically, I am working on digital logic design with FPGAs to implement hardware for simulating neural networks. I have an interest in data mining and analytics, but have not taken any classes involving the subject so far. I am looking forward to learning more about the subject and improving my skills with the tools used in the class.
