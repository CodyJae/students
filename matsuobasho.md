My name is Roma Koulikov.  I am a 2nd year Masters in Business Analytics student.  I spent this past summer working on a
SQL/data cleanupt/data visualization project for a consulting firm.  I would like to get good at Python because
among other reasons, I've seen it can be fun to use once you know what you are doing.  I enjoy (human) languages
and playing guitar.
